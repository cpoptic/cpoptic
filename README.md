### Hi there 👋


- 🔭 I’m currently working on computer vision projects (2D, 3D, video), time-series forecasting, NLP tasks like sentiment analysis on alternative data sources via Transformer models, and applying deep learning techniques to good ol' fashioned tabular datasets, signal processing, AutoML
- 🌱 I’m currently learning pytorch_tabnet, NLP tasks with BERT, how to classify pulmonary embolisms from 3D CT medical image data for the Kaggle compeition.

- 💬 You can often find me ... learning some new machine learning technique, reading and writing code, thinking about how to solve a problem I'm working on while riding my bike.
- 📫 How to reach me: ... chris dot poptic @ gmail dot com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I logged over 10,000 miles riding my bike and won the Ohio State Road Race Championship a few years back.
